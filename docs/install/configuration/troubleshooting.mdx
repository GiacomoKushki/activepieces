### Websocket Connection Issues

If you're experiencing issues with websocket connections, it's likely due to incorrect proxy configuration. Common symptoms include:

- Test Flow button not working
- Test step in flows not working
- Copilot features not working
- Real-time updates not showing

To resolve these issues:

1. Ensure your reverse proxy is properly configured for websocket connections
2. Check our [Setup HTTPS](./setup-ssl) guide for correct configuration examples
3. Some browser block http websocket connections, please setup ssl to resolve this issue.

### Runs with Internal Errors or Scheduling Issues

If you're experiencing issues with flow runs showing internal errors or scheduling problems:

[BullBoard dashboard](/handbook/engineering/playbooks/bullboard)

### Truncated logs

If you see `(truncated)` in the flow run logs in your flow runs, it means that the logs have exceeded the maximum allowed file size. You can increase the `AP_MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB` environment variable to a higher value to resolve this issue.

### Reset Password

If you forgot your password on self hosted instance, you can reset it using the following steps:

**MongoDB**

1. **Locate MongoDB Docker Container**:
   - Use a command like `docker ps` to find the MongoDB container.

2. **Access the Container**:
   - Connect to the MongoDB Docker container using `mongosh`.
   ```bash
   docker exec -it MONGODB_CONTAINER_ID mongosh
   ```

3. **Connect to the ActivePieces Database**:
   ```javascript
   use activepieces
   ```

4. **Create a Secure Password**:
   - Use a tool like [bcrypt-generator.com](https://bcrypt-generator.com/) to generate a new secure password, number of rounds is 10.

5. **Update Your Password**:
   ```javascript
   db.user_identity.updateOne({ email: 'YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS' }, { $set: { password: 'HASH_PASSWORD' } })
   ```

**SQLite3**

1. **Open the SQLite3 Shell**:
   - Access the SQLite3 database by opening the SQLite3 shell. Replace "database.db" with the actual name of your SQLite3 database file if it's different.
   ```bash
   sqlite3 ~/.activepieces/database.sqlite
   ```

2. **Create a Secure Password**:
   - Use a tool like [bcrypt-generator.com](https://bcrypt-generator.com/) to generate a new secure password, number of rounds is 10.

3. **Reset Your Password**:
   - Once inside the SQLite3 shell, you can update your password with an SQL query. Replace `HASH_PASSWORD` with your new password and `YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS` with your email.
   ```sql
   UPDATE user_identity SET password = 'HASH_PASSWORD' WHERE email = 'YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS';
   ```

4. **Exit the SQLite3 Shell**:
   - After making the changes, exit the SQLite3 shell by typing:
   ```bash
   .exit
   ```
